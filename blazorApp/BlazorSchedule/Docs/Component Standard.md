# Good Component Principles
- Every component should have zero errors and warnings.
- Use `{ get; set; }` for properties.
- Implement guard clauses in functions.
- `Console.WriteLine` is acceptable only temporarily.
- The logic of the application should be implemented in the `@code` section.
- Replace `var` with explicit types for better readability.
